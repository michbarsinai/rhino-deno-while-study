# while-study: https://deno.land/[Deno.js] vs Provengo/Rhino

A study of how a `while` variables in a loop behave in Rhino and https://deno.land/[Deno.js].

The output below is from running link:/spec/js/hello-world.js[`/spec/js/hello-world.js`] in this repo. As you can see, Rhino and Deno behave differently for ``const``s that are defined in the loop's body:

Rhino::
  Keeps the value assigned at the first iteration.
Deno::
  Value is updated each iteration (``const``s are removed once they go out of scope, I guess)

<.> While loop in Deno: `const` value changes in each iteration.
